            <p> I'm a quadralingual,Indian born upcoming software developer whose passion is to become a SDE in the future.
                  Tech side apart,I'm a cynophile and a hardcore vegan.
                  I listen to latin and french pop.
                  My favourite pop stars range from The Weeknd,Ariana Grande and Shawn Mendes to Rosalia,Danna Paola,Gims.
                  I watch all Gen Z based tv series(like duh!).
                  I look up to Blair Waldorf as my fashion inspiration.
                  I am planning to move to France one day when I'm not broke , but not as a person with fake accent and botox but as a person who doesn't forgets her culture but still is a party animal
